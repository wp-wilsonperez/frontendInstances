If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * ### Caveat: Option selection\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n *\n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.\n * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.\n *\n * #### Syntax\n *\n * ```\n * <select [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [(ngModel)]=\"selectedCountries\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n *\n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     */\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n        this._compareWith = ɵlooseIdentical;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype, \"compareWith\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"compareWith must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._compareWith = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\n        if (id == null) {\n            this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n        }\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n            _this.value = valueString;\n            fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = function () { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (this._compareWith(this._optionMap.get(id), value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = function (valueString) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = _extractId(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     */\n    function SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n        this._compareWith = ɵlooseIdentical;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype, \"compareWith\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"compareWith must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._compareWith = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ optionSelectedStateSetter;\n        if (Array.isArray(value)) {\n            // convert values to ids\n            var /** @type {?} */ ids_1 = value.map(function (v) { return _this._getOptionId(v); });\n            optionSelectedStateSetter = function (opt, o) { opt._setSelected(ids_1.indexOf(o.toString()) > -1); };\n        }\n        else {\n            optionSelectedStateSetter = function (opt, o) { opt._setSelected(false); };\n        }\n        this._optionMap.forEach(optionSelectedStateSetter);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (_) {\n            var /** @type {?} */ selected = [];\n            if (_.hasOwnProperty('selectedOptions')) {\n                var /** @type {?} */ options = _.selectedOptions;\n                for (var /** @type {?} */ i = 0; i < options.length; i++) {\n                    var /** @type {?} */ opt = options.item(i);\n                    var /** @type {?} */ val = _this._getOptionValue(opt.value);\n                    selected.push(val);\n                }\n            }\n            else {\n                var /** @type {?} */ options = (_.options);\n                for (var /** @type {?} */ i = 0; i < options.length; i++) {\n                    var /** @type {?} */ opt = options.item(i);\n                    if (opt.selected) {\n                        var /** @type {?} */ val = _this._getOptionValue(opt.value);\n                        selected.push(val);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            _this.value = selected;\n            fn(selected);\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = function (value) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = (this._idCounter++).toString();\n        this._optionMap.set(id, value);\n        return id;\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (this._compareWith(this._optionMap.get(id)._value, value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = function (valueString) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = _extractId$1(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

You don't need to add a special selector.\n *\n * You can export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key\n * (ex: `#myForm=\"ngForm\"`). This is optional, but useful.

All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link \\@Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nvar NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        _this._control = new FormControl();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        _this._registered = false;\n        _this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        _this._parent = parent;\n        _this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        _this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        _this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(_this, valueAccessors);\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._control; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?

By default subscription to Observable calls `func`\n     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as last parameter will defer call to input function,\n     * just like wrapping that call in `setTimeout` with time `0` would. So if you use async Scheduler\n     * and call `subscribe` on output Observable, all function calls that are currently executing,\n     * will end before `func` is invoked.\n     *\n     * When it comes to emitting results passed to callback, by default they are emitted\n     * immediately after `func` invokes callback. In particular, if callback is called synchronously,\n     * then subscription to resulting Observable will call `next` function synchronously as well.\n     * If you want to defer that call, using `Scheduler.async` will, again, do the job.\n     * This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can, in a sense, ensure that `func`\n     * always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n     *\n     * Note that Observable created by output function will always emit only one value\n     * and then complete right after. Even if `func` calls callback multiple times, values from\n     * second and following calls will never appear in the stream. If you need to\n     * listen for multiple calls, you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or\n     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n     *\n     * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property), that context will be set\n     * to the same context that output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`\n     * is called as method of some object, in order to preserve proper behaviour,\n     * it is recommended to set context of output function to that object as well,\n     * provided `func` is not already bound.\n     *\n     * If input function calls its callback in \"node style\" (i.e. first argument to callback is\n     * optional error parameter signaling whether call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}\n     * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.\n     * `bindCallback` will treat such functions without any difference and error parameter\n     * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>\n     * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)\n     * var getJSONAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);\n     * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');\n     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Receive array of arguments passed to callback</caption>\n     * someFunction((a, b, c) => {\n     *   console.log(a);

This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\n * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n * );\n * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>\n * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\n * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\n * var bmi = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(weight, height, (w, h) => w / (h * h));\n * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\n *\n * // With output to console:\n * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\n * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\n * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\n *\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link merge}\n * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\n * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\n * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\n * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=null] The IScheduler to use for subscribing to\n * each input Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n * @static true\n * @name combineLatest\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction combineLatest() {\n    var observables = [];\n    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n        observables[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n    }\n    var project = null;\n    var scheduler = null;\n    if (isScheduler_1.isScheduler(observables[observables.length - 1])) {\n        scheduler = observables.pop();\n    }\n    if (typeof observables[observables.length - 1] === 'function') {\n        project = observables.pop();\n    }\n    // if the first and only other argument besides the resultSelector is an array\n    // assume it's been called with `combineLatest([obs1, obs2, obs3], project)`\n    if (observables.length === 1 && isArray_1.isArray(observables[0])) {\n        observables = observables[0];\n    }\n    return new ArrayObservable_1.ArrayObservable(observables, scheduler).lift(new combineLatest_1.CombineLatestOperator(project));\n}\nexports.combineLatest = combineLatest;\n//# sourceMappingURL=combineLatest.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/combineLatest.js\n// module id = 486\n// module chunks = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20","\"use strict\";\nvar concat_1 = require('../operator/concat');\nexports.concat = concat_1.concatStatic;\n//# sourceMappingURL=concat.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/concat.js\n// module id = 487\n// module chunks = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20","\"use strict\";\nvar DeferObservable_1 = require('./DeferObservable');\nexports.defer = DeferObservable_1.DeferObservable.create;\n//# sourceMappingURL=defer.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/defer.js\n// module id = 488\n// module chunks = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?
